These Perl codes enable to calculate 'distribution shift' and 'net expression change' used in my study (reference will be added).

# cal_distshift_allpairstesting_rmBoth0_multithreads.pl
for distribution shift.

# cal_netexpchange_allpairstesting_rmBoth0_multithreads.pl
for net expression change.

These codes need 'transpose.pl', which is involved in this project.
